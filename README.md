# Hello-Triangle

Working on a vulkan based graphics engine. Currently just working through [this tutorial ](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/).

Project goals:
* Both forward rendering and deferred shading pipeline, available on a switch
* SMAA/FXAA for the deferred shader's AA (Or better, based on research)
